# Merkle Tree

Simple merkle tree implementation in Rust based primarily on 
https://github.com/miguelmota/merkletreejs, along with other learnings from https://github.com/roberts-ivanovs/simple-merkle-tree and https://github.com/nervosnetwork/merkle-tree.

The main objective is compatibility with https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/MerkleProof.sol.
